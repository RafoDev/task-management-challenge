## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- Yarn package manager
- GraphQL API endpoint

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory using `.env.example` as a template:

```env
# .env
VITE_GQL_API="https://your-api/graphql"
VITE_GQL_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. Generate TypeScript types for GraphQL queries:

```bash
yarn generate
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`

## ü§î Technical Decisions

### GraphQL with Apollo Client

- Efficient data fetching with precise queries
- Robust caching mechanism
- Real-time updates with optimistic UI

### Type Safety

- GraphQL Codegen for automated type generation
- Zod for runtime validation
- TypeScript for development-time type safety

### Styling Approach

- SCSS Modules chosen for:
  - CSS scoping to prevent style leaks
  - Reusable variables and mixins
  - Better organization with modular approach
